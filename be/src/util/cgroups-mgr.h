/// Control Groups, or 'cgroups', are a Linux-specific mechanism for arbitrating resources
/// amongst threads.
//
/// CGroups are organised in a forest of 'hierarchies', each of which are mounted at a path
/// in the filesystem. Each hierarchy contains one or more cgroups, arranged
/// hierarchically. Each hierarchy has one or more 'subsystems' attached. Each subsystem
/// represents a resource to manage, so for example there is a CPU subsystem and a MEMORY
/// subsystem. There are rules about when subsystems may be attached to more than one
/// hierarchy, which are out of scope of this description.
//
/// Each thread running on a kernel with cgroups enabled belongs to exactly one cgroup in
/// every hierarchy at once. Impala is only concerned with a single hierarchy that assigns
/// CPU resources in the first instance. Threads are assigned to cgroups by writing their
/// thread ID to a file in the special cgroup filesystem.
//
/// For more information:
/// access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Resource_Management_Guide/
/// www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt

/// Manages the lifecycle of Impala-internal cgroups as well as the assignment of
/// execution threads into cgroups.
/// To execute queries Impala requests resources from Yarn via the Llama. Yarn returns
/// granted resources via the Llama in the form or "RM resource ids" that conventionally
/// correspond to a CGroups that the Yarn NM creates. Instead of directly using the
/// NM-provided CGroups, Impala creates and manages its own CGroups for the
/// following reasons:
/// 1. In typical CM/Yarn setups, Impala would not have permissions to write to the tasks
///    file of NM-provided CGroups. It is arguably not even desirable (e.g., for security
///    reasons) for external process to be able to manipulate the permissions of
///    NM-generated CGroups either directly or indirectly.
/// 2. Yarn-granted CGroups are created asynchronously (the AM calls to create the
///    CGroups are non-blocking). From Impala's perspective that means that once Impala
///    receives notice from the Llama that resources have been granted, it cannot
///    assume that the corresponding containers have been created (although the Yarn
///    NMs eventually will). While each of Impala's plan fragments could wait for the
///    CGroups to be created, it seems unnecessarily complicated and slow to do so.
/// 3. Impala will probably want to manage its own CGroups eventually, e.g., for
///    optimistic query scheduling.
//
/// In summary, the typical CGroups-related flow of an Impala query is as follows:
/// 1. Impala receives granted resources from Llama and sends out plan fragments
/// 2. On each node execution such a fragment, convert the Yarn resource id into
///    a CGroup that Impala should create and assign the query's threads to
/// 3. Register the fragment(s) and the CGroup for the query with the
///    node-local CGroup manager. The registration creates the CGroup maintains a
///    count of all fragments using that CGroup.
/// 4. Execute the fragments, assigning threads into the Impala-managed CGroup.
/// 5. Complete the fragments by unregistering them with the CGroup from the node-local
///    CGroups manager. When the last fragment for a CGroup is unregistered, all threads
///    from that CGroup are relocated into a special staging CGroup, so that the now
///    unused CGroup can safely be deleted (otherwise, we'd have to wait for the OS to
///    drain all entries from the CGroup's tasks file)
