/// Implementation of a FifoMultimap.
///
/// The FifoMultimap is a cache-like data structure that keeps `capacity` number of
/// key-value pairs organized and accessible by key allowing multiple values per key. If
/// capacity is reached, key-value pairs are evicted in the least recently added order.
///
/// When accessing the values that have identical keys (via Pop(k)), values are typically
/// returned in LIFO order of this key. However, this property can only be guaranteed when
/// compiled with C++11 enabled. The motivation for accessing values in this particular
/// order is to avoid keeping all values of a particular key hot, even though only a
/// subset of the values is actually used.
///
/// On destruction of this class all resources are freed using the optional deleter
/// function.
///
/// This class is thread-safe and some methods may block under contention. This class
/// cannot be copied or assigned.
///
/// Example of a cache with capacity 3:
///
///   * First `<K1, V1>` is added to the cache, then `<K2, V2>`, `<K2, V3>`.
///
/// Eviction case: If a new key value pair is added `<K1, V1>` will be evicted as it
/// is the oldest entry. (FIFO)
///
/// Element access: If `K2` is accessed, `V3` will be returned first. (LIFO)
///
/// This class is thread-safe and protects its members using a spin lock.
