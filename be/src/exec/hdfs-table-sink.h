//
/// Files and partitions:
/// This sink writes one or more Hdfs files per output partition,
/// corresponding to an Hdfs directory.
/// The Hdfs file names depend on unique_id, and therefore, we rely on the *global*

/// the same unique_id.

/// partition_key_exprs from tsink.

/// Each row may belong to different partition than the one before it.
//
/// Failure behavior:
/// In Exec() all data is written to Hdfs files in a temporary directory.
/// In Close() all temporary Hdfs files are moved to their final locations,
/// while also removing the original files if overwrite was specified, as follows:
/// 1. We move all temporary files to their final destinations.
/// 2. After all tmp files have been moved,
///    we delete the original files if overwrite was specified.
/// There is a possibility of data inconsistency,
/// e.g., if a failure occurs while moving the Hdfs files.
/// The temporary directory is <table base dir>/<unique_id.hi>-<unique_id.lo>_data
/// such that an external tool can easily clean up incomplete inserts.
