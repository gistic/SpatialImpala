/// Exec node that scans an in-memory collection of tuples (an ArrayType) producing
/// one output row per tuple in the collection. The output row is composed of a single
/// tuple - the collection's item tuple.
/// An UnnestNode does not have children and can only appear in the right child of a
/// SubplanNode. The UnnestNode gets its 'input' from its containing SubplanNode.
///
/// Projection: Collection-typed slots are expensive to copy, e.g., during data exchanges
/// or when writing into a buffered-tuple-stream. Such slots are often duplicated many
/// times after unnesting in a SubplanNode. To alleviate this problem, we set the
/// collection-typed slot to be unnested in this node to NULL immediately after
/// retrieving the slot's value. Since the same tuple/slot could be referenced by
/// multiple input rows, we ignore the null bit when retrieving a slot's value because
/// this node itself might have set the bit in a prior Open()/GetNext()*/Reset() cycle.
/// We rely on the producer of the slot value (scan node) to write an empty array value
/// into slots that are NULL, in addition to setting the null bit. This breaks/augments
/// the existing semantics of the null bits.
/// Setting the slot to NULL as early as possible ensures that all rows returned by the
/// containing SubplanNode will have the slot set to NULL.
/// The FE guarantees that the contents of any collection-typed slot are never referenced
/// outside of a single UnnestNode, so setting such a slot to NULL is safe after the
/// UnnestNode has retrieved the array value from the corresponding slot.
/// TODO: Setting the collection-typed slots to NULL should be replaced by a proper
/// projection at materialization points. The current solution purposely ignores the
/// conventional NULL semantics of slots - it is a temporary hack which must be removed.
