/// For every input row from its first child, a SubplanNode evaluates and pulls all

/// 'forwards' the output rows produced by its second child, accumulating them
/// into batches before returning them to its parent in GetNext(). Therefore, it
/// may not have any conjuncts, but it may have a limit.
/// A SubplanNode exposes the current input row it is processing to UnnestNodes and
/// SingularRowSrcNodes that are in the exec-node tree of the second child.

/// Subplan Memory Management:
/// To ensure that the memory backing rows produced by the subplan tree (second child)
/// remains valid for the lifetime of an output batch produced in GetNext(), we rely on
/// our conventional transfer mechanism. That is, the ownership of memory that is no
/// longer used by an exec node inside the subplan tree (second child) is transferred to
/// an output row batch in that node's GetNext() at a "convenient" point, typically
/// at eos or when the memory usage exceeds some threshold. Note that exec nodes may
/// choose not to transfer memory at eos to amortize the cost of memory allocation over
/// multiple Reset()/Open()/GetNext()* cycles.
/// The resources owned by batches from the first child of this node are always
/// transferred to the output batch right before fetching a new batch from the
/// first child.
