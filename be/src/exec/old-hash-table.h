/// TODO: Temporarily moving the old HashTable implementation to make it work with the
/// non-partitioned versions of HJ and AGG. It should be removed once we remove those
/// non-partitioned versions.

/// Hash table implementation designed for hash aggregation and hash joins.  This is not
/// templatized and is tailored to the usage pattern for aggregation and joins.  The
/// hash table store TupleRows and allows for different exprs for insertions and finds.
/// This is the pattern we use for joins and aggregation where the input/build tuple
/// row descriptor is different from the find/probe descriptor.
/// The table is optimized for the query engine's use case as much as possible and is not
/// intended to be a generic hash table implementation.  The API loosely mimics the
/// std::hashset API.
//
/// The hash table stores evaluated expr results for the current row being processed
/// when possible into a contiguous memory buffer. This allows for very efficient
/// computation for hashing.  The implementation is also designed to allow codegen
/// for some paths.
//
/// The hash table does not support removes. The hash table is not thread safe.
//
/// The implementation is based on the boost multiset.  The hashtable is implemented by
/// two data structures: a vector of buckets and a vector of nodes.  Inserted values
/// are stored as nodes (in the order they are inserted).  The buckets (indexed by the
/// mod of the hash) contain pointers to the node vector.  Nodes that fall in the same
/// bucket are linked together (the bucket pointer gets you the head of that linked list).
/// When growing the hash table, the number of buckets is doubled, and nodes from a
/// particular bucket either stay in place or move to an analogous bucket in the second
/// half of buckets. This behavior allows us to avoid moving about half the nodes each
/// time, and maintains good cache properties by only accessing 2 buckets at a time.
/// The node vector is modified in place.
/// Due to the doubling nature of the buckets, we require that the number of buckets is a
/// power of 2. This allows us to determine if a node needs to move by simply checking a
/// single bit, and further allows us to initially hash nodes using a bitmask.
//
/// TODO: this is not a fancy hash table in terms of memory access patterns (cuckoo-hashing
/// or something that spills to disk). We will likely want to invest more time into this.
/// TODO: hash-join and aggregation have very different access patterns.  Joins insert
/// all the rows and then calls scan to find them.  Aggregation interleaves Find() and
/// Inserts().  We can want to optimize joins more heavily for Inserts() (in particular
/// growing).
