  ///      them into hash_partitions_. This is a fixed fan out of the input. The input
  ///      can either come from child(1) OR from the build tuple stream of partition
  ///      that needs to be repartitioned.
  ///   2. [PROCESSING_PROBE or REPARTITIONING] Read the probe side rows, partition them
  ///      and either perform the join or spill them into hash_partitions_. If the
  ///      partition has the hash table in memory, we perform the join, otherwise we
  ///      spill the probe row. Similar to step one, the rows can come from child(0) or
  ///      a spilled partition.
