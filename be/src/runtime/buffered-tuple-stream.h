/// Class that provides an abstraction for a stream of tuple rows. Rows can be
/// added to the stream and returned. Rows are returned in the order they are added.
///
/// The underlying memory management is done by the BufferedBlockMgr.
///
/// The tuple stream consists of a number of small (less than IO-sized blocks) before
/// an arbitrary number of IO-sized blocks. The smaller blocks do not spill and are
/// there to lower the minimum buffering requirements. For example, an operator that
/// needs to maintain 64 streams (1 buffer per partition) would need, by default,
/// 64 * 8MB = 512MB of buffering. A query with 5 of these operators would require
/// 2.56GB just to run, regardless of how much of that is used. This is
/// problematic for small queries. Instead we will start with a fixed number of small
/// buffers (currently 2 small buffers: one 64KB and one 512KB) and only start using IO
/// sized buffers when those fill up. The small buffers never spill.
/// The stream will *not* automatically switch from using small buffers to IO-sized
/// buffers when all the small buffers for this stream have been used.
///
/// The BufferedTupleStream is *not* thread safe from the caller's point of view. It is
/// expected that all the APIs are called from a single thread. Internally, the
/// object is thread safe wrt to the underlying block mgr.
///
/// Buffer management:
/// The stream is either pinned or unpinned, set via PinStream() and UnpinStream().
/// Blocks are optionally deleted as they are read, set with the delete_on_read c'tor
/// parameter.
///
/// Block layout:
/// At the header of each block, starting at position 0, there is a bitstring with null
/// indicators for all the tuples in each row in the block. Then there are the tuple rows.
/// We further optimize the codepaths when we know that no tuple is nullable, indicated
/// by 'nullable_tuple_'.
///
/// Tuple row layout:
/// Tuples are stored back to back. Each tuple starts with the fixed length portion,
/// directly followed by the var len portion. (Fixed len and var len are interleaved).
/// If any tuple in the row is nullable, then there is a bitstring of null tuple
/// indicators at the header of the block. The order of bits in the null indicators
/// bitstring corresponds to the order of tuples in the block. The NULL tuples are not
/// stored in the body of the block, only as set bits in the null indicators bitsting.
///
/// The behavior of reads and writes is as follows:
/// Read:
///   1. Delete on read (delete_on_read_): Blocks are deleted as we go through the stream.
///   The data returned by the tuple stream is valid until the next read call so the
///   caller does not need to copy if it is streaming.
///   2. Unpinned: Blocks remain in blocks_ and are unpinned after reading.
///   3. Pinned: Blocks remain in blocks_ and are left pinned after reading. If the next
///   block in the stream cannot be pinned, the read call will fail and the caller needs
///   to free memory from the underlying block mgr.
/// Write:
///   1. Unpinned: Unpin blocks as they fill up. This means only a single (i.e. the
///   current) block needs to be in memory regardless of the input size (if read_write is
///   true, then two blocks need to be in memory).
///   2. Pinned: Blocks are left pinned. If we run out of blocks, the write will fail and
///   the caller needs to free memory from the underlying block mgr.
///
/// TODO: we need to be able to do read ahead in the BufferedBlockMgr. It currently
/// only has PinAllBlocks() which is blocking. We need a non-blocking version of this or
/// some way to indicate a block will need to be pinned soon.
/// TODO: see if this can be merged with Sorter::Run. The key difference is that this
/// does not need to return rows in the order they were added, which allows it to be
/// simpler.
/// TODO: we could compact the small buffers when we need to spill but they use very
/// little memory so ths might not be very useful.
/// TODO: improvements:
///   - Think about how to layout for the var len data more, possibly filling in them
///     from the end of the same block. Don't interleave fixed and var len data.
///   - It would be good to allocate the null indicators at the end of each block and grow
///     this array as new rows are inserted in the block. If we do so, then there will be
///     fewer gaps in case of many rows with NULL tuples.
///   - We will want to multithread this. Add a AddBlock() call so the synchronization
///     happens at the block level. This is a natural extension.
///   - Instead of allocating all blocks from the block_mgr, allocate some blocks that
///     are much smaller (e.g. 16K and doubling up to the block size). This way, very
///     small streams (a common case) will use very little memory. This small blocks
///     are always in memory since spilling them frees up negligible memory.
///   - Return row batches in GetNext() instead of filling one in
///   - Should we 32-bit align the start of the tuple rows? Now it is byte-aligned.
