/// A MemTracker tracks memory consumption; it contains an optional limit
/// and can be arranged into a tree structure such that the consumption tracked
/// by a MemTracker is also tracked by its ancestors.
//
/// By default, memory consumption is tracked via calls to Consume()/Release(), either to
/// the tracker itself or to one of its descendents. Alternatively, a consumption metric
/// can specified, and then the metric's value is used as the consumption rather than the
/// tally maintained by Consume() and Release(). A tcmalloc metric is used to track process
/// memory consumption, since the process memory usage may be higher than the computed
/// total memory (tcmalloc does not release deallocated memory immediately).
//
/// GcFunctions can be attached to a MemTracker in order to free up memory if the limit is
/// reached. If LimitExceeded() is called and the limit is exceeded, it will first call the
/// GcFunctions to try to free memory and recheck the limit. For example, the process
/// tracker has a GcFunction that releases any unused memory still held by tcmalloc, so
/// this will be called before the process limit is reported as exceeded. GcFunctions are
/// called in the order they are added, so expensive functions should be added last.
