/// A MemPool maintains a list of memory chunks from which it allocates memory in
/// response to Allocate() calls;
/// Chunks stay around for the lifetime of the mempool or until they are passed on to
/// another mempool.
//
/// The caller registers a MemTracker with the pool; chunk allocations are counted
/// against that tracker and all of its ancestors. If chunks get moved between pools
/// during AcquireData() calls, the respective MemTrackers are updated accordingly.
/// Chunks freed up in the d'tor are subtracted from the registered trackers.
//
/// An Allocate() call will attempt to allocate memory from the chunk that was most
/// recently added; if that chunk doesn't have enough memory to
/// satisfy the allocation request, the free chunks are searched for one that is
/// big enough otherwise a new chunk is added to the list.
/// The current_chunk_idx_ always points to the last chunk with allocated memory.
/// In order to keep allocation overhead low, chunk sizes double with each new one
/// added, until they hit a maximum size.
//
///     Example:
///     MemPool* p = new MemPool();
///     for (int i = 0; i < 1024; ++i) {
/// returns 8-byte aligned memory (effectively 24 bytes):
///       .. = p->Allocate(17);
///     }
/// at this point, 17K have been handed out in response to Allocate() calls and
/// 28K of chunks have been allocated (chunk sizes: 4K, 8K, 16K)
/// We track total and peak allocated bytes. At this point they would be the same:
/// 28k bytes.  A call to Clear will return the allocated memory so
/// total_allocate_bytes_
/// becomes 0 while peak_allocate_bytes_ remains at 28k.
///     p->Clear();
/// the entire 1st chunk is returned:
///     .. = p->Allocate(4 * 1024);
/// 4K of the 2nd chunk are returned:
///     .. = p->Allocate(4 * 1024);
/// a new 20K chunk is created
///     .. = p->Allocate(20 * 1024);
//
///      MemPool* p2 = new MemPool();
/// the new mempool receives all chunks containing data from p
///      p2->AcquireData(p, false);
/// At this point p.total_allocated_bytes_ would be 0 while p.peak_allocated_bytes_
/// remains unchanged.
/// The one remaining (empty) chunk is released:
///    delete p;
