/// service symbol lookups. We can't cache the module since it (i.e. the external
/// module) is consumed when it is linked with the query codegen module.

/// one of the operations is copying a file from HDFS. With one lock that would
/// prevent any UDFs from running on the system. Instead, we have a global lock
/// that is taken when doing the cache lookup, but is not taking during any blocking calls.
/// During the block calls, we take the per-lib lock.
//
/// Entry lifetime management: We cannot delete the entry while a query is
/// using the library. When the caller requests a ptr into the library, they
/// are given the entry handle and must decrement the ref count when they
/// are done.
