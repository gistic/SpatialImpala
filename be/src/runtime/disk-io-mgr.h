/// Manager object that schedules IO for all queries on all disks and remote filesystems
/// (such as S3). Each query maps to one or more RequestContext objects, each of which
/// has its own queue of scan ranges and/or write ranges.
//
/// The API splits up requesting scan/write ranges (non-blocking) and reading the data
/// (blocking). The DiskIoMgr has worker threads that will read from and write to
/// disk/hdfs/remote-filesystems, allowing interleaving of IO and CPU. This allows us to
/// keep all disks and all cores as busy as possible.
//
/// All public APIs are thread-safe. It is not valid to call any of the APIs after
/// UnregisterContext() returns.
//
/// For Readers:
/// We can model this problem as a multiple producer (threads for each disk), multiple
/// consumer (scan ranges) problem. There are multiple queues that need to be
/// synchronized. Conceptually, there are two queues:
///   1. The per disk queue: this contains a queue of readers that need reads.
///   2. The per scan range ready-buffer queue: this contains buffers that have been
///      read and are ready for the caller.
/// The disk queue contains a queue of readers and is scheduled in a round robin fashion.
/// Readers map to scan nodes. The reader then contains a queue of scan ranges. The caller
/// asks the IoMgr for the next range to process. The IoMgr then selects the best range
/// to read based on disk activity and begins reading and queuing buffers for that range.
/// TODO: We should map readers to queries. A reader is the unit of scheduling and queries
/// that have multiple scan nodes shouldn't have more 'turns'.
//
/// For Writers:
/// Data is written via AddWriteRange(). This is non-blocking and adds a WriteRange to a
/// per-disk queue. After the write is complete, a callback in WriteRange is invoked.
/// No memory is allocated within IoMgr for writes and no copies are made. It is the
/// responsibility of the client to ensure that the data to be written is valid and that
/// the file to be written to exists until the callback is invoked.
//
/// The IoMgr provides three key APIs.
///  1. AddScanRanges: this is non-blocking and tells the IoMgr all the ranges that
///     will eventually need to be read.
///  2. GetNextRange: returns to the caller the next scan range it should process.
///     This is based on disk load. This also begins reading the data in this scan
///     range. This is blocking.
///  3. ScanRange::GetNext: returns the next buffer for this range.  This is blocking.
//
/// The disk threads do not synchronize with each other. The readers and writers don't
/// synchronize with each other. There is a lock and condition variable for each request
/// context queue and each disk queue.
/// IMPORTANT: whenever both locks are needed, the lock order is to grab the context lock
/// before the disk lock.
//
/// Scheduling: If there are multiple request contexts with work for a single disk, the
/// request contexts are scheduled in round-robin order. Multiple disk threads can
/// operate on the same request context. Exactly one request range is processed by a
/// disk thread at a time. If there are multiple scan ranges scheduled via
/// GetNextRange() for a single context, these are processed in round-robin order.
/// If there are multiple scan and write ranges for a disk, a read is always followed
/// by a write, and a write is followed by a read, i.e. reads and writes alternate.
/// If multiple write ranges are enqueued for a single disk, they will be processed
/// by the disk threads in order, but may complete in any order. No guarantees are made
/// on ordering of writes across disks.
//
/// Resource Management: effective resource management in the IoMgr is key to good
/// performance. The IoMgr helps coordinate two resources: CPU and disk. For CPU,
/// spinning up too many threads causes thrashing.
/// Memory usage in the IoMgr comes from queued read buffers.  If we queue the minimum
/// (i.e. 1), then the disks are idle while we are processing the buffer. If we don't
/// limit the queue, then it possible we end up queueing the entire data set (i.e. CPU
/// is slower than disks) and run out of memory.
/// For both CPU and memory, we want to model the machine as having a fixed amount of
/// resources.  If a single query is running, it should saturate either CPU or Disk
/// as well as using as little memory as possible. With multiple queries, each query
/// should get less CPU. In that case each query will need fewer queued buffers and
/// therefore have less memory usage.
//
/// The IoMgr defers CPU management to the caller. The IoMgr provides a GetNextRange
/// API which will return the next scan range the caller should process. The caller
/// can call this from the desired number of reading threads. Once a scan range
/// has been returned via GetNextRange, the IoMgr will start to buffer reads for
/// that range and it is expected the caller will pull those buffers promptly. For
/// example, if the caller would like to have 1 scanner thread, the read loop
/// would look like:
///   while (more_ranges)
///     range = GetNextRange()
///     while (!range.eosr)
///       buffer = range.GetNext()
/// To have multiple reading threads, the caller would simply spin up the threads
/// and each would process the loops above.
//
/// To control the number of IO buffers, each scan range has a soft max capacity for
/// the number of queued buffers. If the number of buffers is at capacity, the IoMgr
/// will no longer read for that scan range until the caller has processed a buffer.
/// This capacity does not need to be fixed, and the caller can dynamically adjust
/// it if necessary.
//
/// As an example: If we allowed 5 buffers per range on a 24 core, 72 thread
/// (we default to allowing 3x threads) machine, we should see at most
/// 72 * 5 * 8MB = 2.8GB in io buffers memory usage. This should remain roughly constant
/// regardless of how many concurrent readers are running.
//
/// Buffer Management:
/// Buffers are allocated by the IoMgr as necessary to service reads. These buffers
/// are directly returned to the caller. The caller must call Return() on the buffer
/// when it is done, at which point the buffer will be recycled for another read. In error
/// cases, the IoMgr will recycle the buffers more promptly but regardless, the caller
/// must always call Return()
//
/// Caching support:
/// Scan ranges contain metadata on whether or not it is cached on the DN. In that
/// case, we use the HDFS APIs to read the cached data without doing any copies. For these
/// ranges, the reads happen on the caller thread (as opposed to the disk threads).
/// It is possible for the cached read APIs to fail, in which case the ranges are then
/// queued on the disk threads and behave identically to the case where the range
/// is not cached.
/// Resources for these ranges are also not accounted against the reader because none
/// are consumed.
/// While a cached block is being processed, the block is mlocked. We want to minimize
/// the time the mlock is held.
///   - HDFS will time us out if we hold onto the mlock for too long
///   - Holding the lock prevents uncaching this file due to a caching policy change.
/// Therefore, we only issue the cached read when the caller is ready to process the
/// range (GetNextRange()) instead of when the ranges are issued. This guarantees that
/// there will be a CPU available to process the buffer and any throttling we do with
/// the number of scanner threads properly controls the amount of files we mlock.
/// With cached scan ranges, we cannot close the scan range until the cached buffer
/// is returned (HDFS does not allow this). We therefore need to defer the close until
/// the cached buffer is returned (BufferDescriptor::Return()).
//
/// Remote filesystem support (e.g. S3):
/// Remote filesystems are modeled as "remote disks". That is, there is a seperate disk
/// queue for each supported remote filesystem type. In order to maximize throughput,
/// multiple connections are opened in parallel by having multiple threads running per
/// queue. Also note that reading from a remote filesystem service can be more CPU
/// intensive than local disk/hdfs because of non-direct I/O and SSL processing, and can
/// be CPU bottlenecked especially if not enough I/O threads for these queues are
/// started.
//
/// TODO: IoMgr should be able to request additional scan ranges from the coordinator
/// to help deal with stragglers.
/// TODO: look into using a lock free queue
/// TODO: simplify the common path (less locking, memory allocations).
/// TODO: Break this up the .h/.cc into multiple files under an /io subdirectory.
