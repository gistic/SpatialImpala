class Plugin(object):
  '''Base plugin class.

  Defines the interfaces that all plugins will use.
  The interface consists of:
     * The scope, which defines when the plugin will run.
       The different scopes are:
         * per query
         * per workload
         * per test suite run
     * A pre-hook method, which is run at the beginning of the 'scope'
     * A post-hook method, which is run at the end of the scope.
