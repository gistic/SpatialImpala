This package runs the query generator continuously. Compares Impala and Postgres results
for a randomly generated query and produces several reports per day. Reports are
displayed on a web page which allows the user to conveniently examine the discovered
issues. The user can also start a custom run against a private Impala branch using the
web interface.

Requirements:

1) Docker -- A docker image with Impala and Postgres installed and functional database
      loaded into Postgres.

2) Fabric

      sudo pip install fabric

3) Flask

      sudo pip install Flask

To get started, run ./controller.py and ./front_end.py. Results and logs are saved to
/tmp/query_gen
