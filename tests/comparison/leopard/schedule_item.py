    git_command (str): Custom command to execute before starting a run.
    query_profile (DefaultProfile or similar)
    parent_job (str): job_id of the parent job
    parent_job_name (str): used for displaying the parent job name on the front page (in
        the schedule section)
    job_id (str): Unique string associated with this run. It is generated here and will
        be the same in Job and Report. The file name of pickle object will be this
        string.
    time_limit_sec (Number): Number of seconds to run.
