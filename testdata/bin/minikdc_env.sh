# variables in case we need to change anything.
#
# Notes on principals.
# * We don't use the YARN principal; instead we use impala so that all the
#   appropriate directories are owned by impala
# * We don't use the ${USER} principal, we use impala - for the same reasons.
# * Once I tried to swap out ${USER} for impala everywhere.  The impala daemons
#   came up fine, but some of the test code fell over.  Plus you have to tell
#   the impala shell that the principal isn't 'impala'.
