This directory contains Impala test data sets. The directory layout is structured as follows:

datasets/
   <data set>/<data set>_schema_template.sql
   <data set>/<data files SF1>/data files
   <data set>/<data files SF2>/data files

Where SF is the scale factor controlling data size. This allows for scaling the same schema to
different sizes based on the target test environment.
